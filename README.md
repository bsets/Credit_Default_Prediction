# Credit_Default_Prediction
Predicting Credit Default using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

This repository contains code for predicting credit default using logistic regression, random forest and deep learning algorithms. 
The training and test data have been cleaned and uploaded as csv files. The raw data has also been provided that can be then cleaned using the code provided to arrive at the cleaned dataset.

The codes of logistic regression, random forest and deep learning have been uploaded as separate jupyter notebooks that can be run independently. 

For example, for running the Logistic Regression code, open the notebook Logistic_Regression.ipynb and run all the cells. Similarly, to run the Random Forest and Deep Learning codes, open the Random_Forest .ipynb and Deep_Learning.ipynb notebooks respectively and run all the cells. You might have to install some packages to run the code but all of them are open source and can be installed through pip install packages.
